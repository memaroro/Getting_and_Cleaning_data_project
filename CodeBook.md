* Information about the data set:
 
 ·The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers (subject) 

 ·Each person performed six activities (activiti labels)wearing s smartphone on the waist:
    1.WALKING
    2.WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    3.WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    4.SITTING
    5.LAYING
    6.STANDING
    
 · We captured using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial(x, y, z) linear acceleration and 3-axial angular     velocity.

 · The obtained data set has been randomly partitioned into to sets: 1.training data  2.test data.
 
 · The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitacional and body motion components.
 
 · For each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
